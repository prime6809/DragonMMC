Notes on getting OS-9 working on DragonMMC.

Requirements :

boot_dmmc and diskdmmc from Nitros9 (currently not merged).
LOADAT OS-9 command written by me.
MODBUSTER OS-9 command part of Nitros-EOU project.
The Toolshed tools from the Nitros9 project.

The disk image was built with MESS running DragonData OS-9.

Procedure :

Format a blank disk image to hold the modules to build the system with 
os9 format -d -t40 -e modules.os9

Create folders for the OS9 and mmc modules :
os9 makdir modules.os9,os9
os9 makdir modules.os9,mmc

Copy LOADAT and MODBUSTER to the modules disk :
os9 copy loadat modules.os9,loadat
os9 copy modbuster modules.os9,modbuster

Copy boot_mmc diskmmc and the disk descriptors (From Nitros) to the disk
os9 copy boot_dmmc ../modules.os9,mmc/boot
os9 copy d0_40s.dd ../modules.os9,mmc/d0
os9 copy d1_40s.dd ../modules.os9,mmc/d1
os9 copy d2_40s.dd ../modules.os9,mmc/d2
os9 copy d3_40s.dd ../modules.os9,mmc/d3
os9 copy dmmcdisk.dr ../modules.os9,mmc/ddisk

Create files containg the mmc bootlist (blmmc) :
****************** NOTE ***************** 
** MUST have correct (CR) line endings **
*****************************************
OS9/IOMAN
OS9/RBF
MMC/DDISK
MMC/D0
MMC/D1
MMC/D2
MMC/D3
OS9/SCF
OS9/KBVDIO
OS9/TERM
OS9/T1
OS9/P1
OS9/PRINTER
OS9/P
OS9/PIPEMAN
OS9/PIPER
OS9/PIPE
OS9/CLOCK
OS9/SYSGO
OS9/SHELL

copy this to the modules disk :
os9 copy blmmc modules.os9,blmmc

Boot OS-9 with the modules.os9 disk in /d1 and the boot disk in /d0
put the disk to be prepared for mmc boot in /d3 a good example would 
be a copy of the Dragon OS-9 disk, but ensure that it has enough room
for the bootfile.

In the OS-9 shell change directory to /d1/os9 and run modbuster, then 
change back to the root of d1

chd /d1/os9
/d1/modbuster /d0/OS9Boot
chd /d1

This will extract the modules from the current OS-9 boot file to the
/d1/os9 folder

Before making the MMC boot disk we need to replace the boot module in 
memory with the MMC one, this is safe to do as this code is only used 
whilst booting the system. Once the main disk driver is running it is
safe to replace it.

To do this we will need to use the LOADAT command to load the new boot
module over the top of the old one. The new one must obviously be smaller
or equal size. 

To find the Load address use the MDIR command with the E flag note the 
starting address of boot (e.g. for me it was $FD75), you will also need
the length of the replacement boot file this can be found with 
DIR E /d1/mmc

Once you have these you can load the new boot file :

loadat FD75 013A /d1/mmc/boot

Note both the address and size **MUST** be 4 digits.

We are now ready to to make the boot disk with :

os9gen /d3 < blmmc

This will make the boot file on that disk, rewrite to boot track and
link the new boot file, this should now be able to be booted from the 
DragonMMC.
