Notes on getting OS-9 working on DragonMMC.

Requirements :

mboot and mdisk + d0,d1,d2,d3 modules on the modules.os9 
disk image
LOADAT and MODBUST OS-9 commands on the mmcutil.os9 disk image.
LWTOOLS (specifically lwasm) available from http://www.lwtools.ca/
The Toolshed tools from the Nitros9 project.

The disk image was built with MESS running DragonData OS-9.

Procedure :

Run make in this directory, this will build all the required modules and
make two disk images modules.os9 and mmcutil.os9

Create files containg the mmc bootlist (blmmc) :
This is created on the modules disk but is included here for refference.
This is also the list for the Dragon, the CoCo list will be slightly different

Boot OS-9 with the following disks in drives :
d0: Standard OS-9 boot disk
d1: modules.os9 
d2: mmcutil.os9
d3: Target disk to become mmc boot, e.g. a copy of standard boot disk.

Put the disk to be prepared for mmc boot in /d3 a good example would 
be a copy of the Dragon OS-9 disk, but ensure that it has enough room
for the bootfile.

In the OS-9 shell change directory to /d1/os9 and run modbuster, then 
change back to the root of d1

chd /d1/os9
/d2/cmds/modbust /d0/OS9Boot
chd /d1

Alternately, modbust can have the output path specified :

/d2/cmds/modbust /d0/OS9Boot /d1/os9

This will extract the modules from the current OS-9 boot file to the
/d1/os9 folder

Before making the MMC boot disk we need to replace the boot module in 
memory with the MMC one, this is safe to do as this code is only used 
whilst booting the system. Once the main disk driver is running it is
safe to replace it.

To do this we will need to use the LOADAT command to load the new boot
module over the top of the old one. The new one must obviously be smaller
or equal size. 

To find the Load address use the MDIR command with the E flag note the 
starting address of boot (e.g. for me it was $FD75), you will also need
the length of the replacement boot file this can be found with 
DIR E /d1/mmc

Once you have these you can load the new boot file :

/d2/cmds/loadat FD75 13A /d1/mmc/boot

We are now ready to to make the boot disk with :

os9gen /d3 < blmmc

This will make the boot file on that disk, rewrite to boot track and
link the new boot file, this should now be able to be booted from the 
DragonMMC.
