This is the source archive for DragonMMC, it contains the following sections :


AVRFirmware.	

The firmware in C for the ATMega1284 microcontroller, to build this you will need the 
AVR command line tools available from the Atmel / Microchip website. 
Also included is the bootloader firmware for the microcontroller.


Dragon Firmware.

The 6809 code that makes up the new basic commands, DOS emulation and communication 
with the AVR microcontroller. This is built with lwasm, available from the lwtools 
website : http://www.lwtools.ca/

Xilinx firmware. 

The Verilog source and asociated support files needed to build the code for the 
XC95144XL CPLD on the board. This handles signal routing address decoding and latching
of data between the AVR microcontroller and the 6809.
To build this you will need Xilinx Webpack, at the time of writing this is available 
from : https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/ise-design-suite/ise-webpack.html


Both the AVR and 6809 firmware is built from a Makefile, plus supporting utilities, if
you use a Linux / Unix based operating system these will generally already be installed.
If you use windows there are a number of options such as Cygwin / MINGW, under 
Windows 10 you may also be able to used "Windows Services for Linux". I personally use 
Cygwin.
